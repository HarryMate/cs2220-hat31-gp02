Week: 1 (01/02/22)

Assigned actions
==============

Action 1: read SE.QA.04 and start work on material for the user interface document. 
They will also start putting together some possible screens in Powerpoint.

I have started brainstorming how to create the UI. I have decided to use Adobe XD to design and google slides to prototype it.
Haven't done as much as i'd like in terms of designing but I have a better idea of how we'll move forward with it. Will also consider any better options for designing and prototyping for Tom.
I will also try and get the designs done quicker to give Josh more time to make the design in HTML and CSS.
The design is also feeling unfinished so. More colour and graphics needed as it feels like a wireframe at the minute. 
Haven't finished designing all the pages.

Hours: 2

Other project work
================
Made a Group chat on WhatsApp that some need to join.
Met at the library to touch base, and some people still need to login into gitlab with their account so they can be added to the repo.
Once we are all able to communicate through the group chat I think we will be more organised. 
Reading over the group project documents.

Week: 2 (08/02/22)

Assigned actions
==============
Action 1: Oliver and Tom will identify typical users, use cases and 
use case descriptions, to improve existing screens and identify new screens.

I have made good progress on the design itself and how I think it should look. The prototype is functional.
I have also been able to make a first version of the Use Case Document which I'm sure will need refining.
The design and prototype took up a large majority of my time over the weekend, 
maybe would be best if I did more spaced out work on the design over the week instead of 6 hours over the course of the weekend. 
Forgot to add FR4 and FR5. I am aiming to have all the design done by the end of next week.
