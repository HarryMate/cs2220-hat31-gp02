Assigned actions
==============
Rafal, Josh, Oliver need to do review meeting and release test spec document
ACTION: rat24, jop65, olh20

The review meeting went well and we found any issues with the test spec which were thankfully only document formatting issues.
I released the document in time.

Hours: 1

Harry, Oliver check to see if Harry's backend code can work with Reatc/Next.js
ACTION: hat31, olh20

I did some research and found something called Prisma, which is meant to allow connection between relational databases and next.js.
However it didn't go well as I can't seem to connect. I fear it may be an issue with how to school's databases is set up.

Hours: 2

Updated the prototype and changed the design language a bit so it isn't so jarring.
