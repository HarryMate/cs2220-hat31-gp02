Week: 1 (01/02/22)

Assigned actions
==============

Action 1: read SE.QA.04 and start work on material for the user interface document. 
They will also start putting together some possible screens in Powerpoint.

I have started brainstorming how to create the UI. I have decided to use Adobe XD to design and google slides to prototype it.
Haven't done as much as i'd like in terms of designing but I have a better idea of how we'll move forward with it. Will also consider any better options for designing and prototyping for Tom.
I will also try and get the designs done quicker to give Josh more time to make the design in HTML and CSS.
The design is also feeling unfinished so. More colour and graphics needed as it feels like a wireframe at the minute. 
Haven't finished designing all the pages.

Hours: 2

Other project work
================
Made a Group chat on WhatsApp that some need to join.
Met at the library to touch base, and some people still need to login into gitlab with their account so they can be added to the repo.
Once we are all able to communicate through the group chat I think we will be more organised. 
Reading over the group project documents.

Hours: 1

Total hours: 3
