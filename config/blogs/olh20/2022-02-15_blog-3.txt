==============
1. Oliver and Tom finish prototype and design spec and use case document

I have finished a first draft of the prototype, it includes the Quiz maintainer, Quiz master and Participant view. 
It took quite a while to do because I only had the Quiz master view done last week.
There is always room for tinkering.
I am leaving the annotations and connection to the FR to Tom

The use case document is more refined and is ready for the review.
