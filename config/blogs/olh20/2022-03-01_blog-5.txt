Assigned actions
==============
1. Test out React/Next.js by making some sort of prototype to see how easy it is to get started with React
ACTION: olh20, rat24

I have spent some time teaching myself React.js. I was quite surprised about how easy it was. I can immidetaly see the benefits of using it in the project. It makes things like reactively 
changing which question type to fill in depending on the dropdown menu selection. I am also a fan of how data is passed down components and that everything is in a component style.
Need to look into Next.js

I am wondering how well React will play into using PHP. Hopefully it works well but I will need to do further research
