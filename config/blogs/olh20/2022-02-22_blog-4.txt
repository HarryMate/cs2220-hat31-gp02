Assigned actions
==============
1. Tom fixes Use cases
	Oliver adds some mobile views for the prototype
ACTION: toc27, olh20

I added some mobile views to the prototype to demonstrate their relevance in the design. 
Tom has fixed the use cases and added much more detail. I simply connected the FR in his use cases and descriptions.

Tom, Josh and I did the formal review of the UI Spec on Saturday over Discord and we found that everything was very detailed. 
However we thought it would be best if the non functional requirements were included in the use cases as well.
