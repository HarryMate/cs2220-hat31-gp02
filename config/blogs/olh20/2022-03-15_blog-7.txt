Assigned actions
==============
Harry does section 4 of design spec, Tom does section 3 of design spec, Oliver does section 2 of design spec
ACTION: hat31, toc27, olh20
I have done a first draft of my assigned section for the design spec (section 2), which includes some diagrams and descriptions of
the overall hierarchy and architecture of the project.

Hours: 1

Oliver possibly meet Alun Jones (auj) in Physical science building, room 2.34
ACTION: olh20
I didn't end up organising a meeting with Alun since I managed to workaround the issue I was having and I now have a better understanding
of Restful APIs because of it. I think Rest APIs are going to be important in the backend development of the project and doesn't seem to
be too difficult. It involves the Express library.

Hours: 2

Oliver look into keeping backend code out of the front end for security.
ACTION: olh20
I have researched something called env files which appear to be most peoples solutions to the problem of not having db details in plain sight.

Hours: 1

Total Hours: 4

I have also been looking into firebase a bit more. I do think firebase would be a good idea too but we can't use both firebase and postgres.
Firebase has some really good authentication that even handles sessions without needing to write any extra code. I'm not sure which way we should
go with the backend any more.
