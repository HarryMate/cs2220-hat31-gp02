Assigned actions
==============

Action 1: Design Spec

I have done 4.1, but 4.2 in SE.QA05 is not worded correctly, so it's either a mistake or there is something missing on it.
I need to ask Chris if how I did 4.1 was correct, and what I should do with 4.2, as there are things I don't understand about how to do it.

Hours: 1

Action 2: Look into Laravel

I think it's a good idea, it has built in authentication and authorisation, as well as built in next.js functionality so it will work as a backend for the project.
I need to look more into using it as a backend and can do that with a new prototype when I get it to work.
