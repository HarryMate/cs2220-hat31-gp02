Assigned actions
==============

Action 1: Investigate options for persistent storage

Looked at different types of databases and decided which ones would be best. Compared MySQL and PostgreSQL to understand which would be better for this project. Began designing a rough database schema for the system. Researched into the importing and exporting requirements of the project, and discovered how it's possible, and thought about how it would work in the system.
