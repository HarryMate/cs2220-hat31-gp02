Week 3 (22/02/22)

Assigned Actions
================

Action 1: Continued To Look At The Technical Issues Of The Project - HTML/CSS
Created a 3rd digital prototype that shows what the website will look like in terms of the layout of the website, colour schemes and the content on 
each of the pages. 

I started looking at the updated version of how the website should look like which was implemented by both Oliver and Tom. 
Any changes that was made in the design was implemented into the website such as created a new page to allow the quiz to be run. 
In terms of the creation of the website, it's going very well with everything in the design being implemented in the website and is alomost ready 
for Harry, myself and others to start implementing PHP code into the website and to try and get some date entered into the database and reading 
them from the database. 

Action 2: Organisation Of HTML / CSS Code
After completing the changes that was made from this week's design that was created by both Oliver and Tom, I organised the code for both HTML & CSS because
it looked difficult to understand what the code was doing for each page of the website. So I decided to comment on each code on each of the pages so everyone
else in the group alongside myself and the project manager know what each of the code does in the website. Also, I've created a CSS file and included 
all CSS code in that because it makes tidy.
