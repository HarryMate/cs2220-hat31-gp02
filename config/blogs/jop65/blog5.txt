Action 1: Continued To Look At The Technical Issues Of The Project
Created a 5th digital prototype of the quiz website with some additions such as new pages on the website that Oliver acknowledge that I haven't created.

Looked at the updated version of the prototype that both Oliver and Tom had worked on to see which pages on the website that I have missed alongside getting
Young to do some CSS for the new pages that I have created. Also, I've identified more parts on the website that requires JavaScript code such as an error 
message if the Quiz Maintainer does not fill in the question, mark and either 2 answers for the multiple choice question or True or False alongside have 
a message displaying that the user has succssfully logged in.
