Week: 1 (20/01/22)

Action 1: read SE.QA.06 and start drafting a list of repeatable tests. sketch some tests for functional requirements (FR1, FR2, FR3) from the Requirements specification.

I have read the SE.QA.06 documentation, created a short list of tests for FR1, FR2, FR3 as well as the testing table for those. I was not sure if I am doing it right that's
why I haven't done more.
